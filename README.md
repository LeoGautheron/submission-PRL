## Dependencies
Python 3.7.4 and some python3 libraries:
 - numpy (v1.16.5 used)
 - sklearn (v0.24.1 used)
 - pandas (v1.1.5 used)
 - Cython (v0.29.13 used) (to compile through pyximport our base tree algorithm)
 - matplotlib (v3.1.1 used) (to plot resulting figures)
 - graphviz (v0.14.2 used) (to plot the actual trees)
 - xgboost (v1.0.2 used)
 - rpy2 (v3.4.2 used) (to launch the R code of TreeRank from Python)

R in version 3.6.3 along with the R package 'rpart' (that builds decision trees in R)

## Content
folder 'datasets'
 - contains the data for of the 28 datasets used in the experiments (there are 25 files because we generate 3 datasets from 'abalone.data', and 2 datasets from 'yeast.data', and 1 dataset for each remaining file)

file 'main.py'
 - launches the experiments on the 28 datasets and produces a result file in a folder 'result' named 'res{seed}.pklz' where the random number generator seed is the value passed through the command line.
 - in practice we launched with seeds from 1 to 20

folder 'results'
 - for reproductibility, we provide the 20 result files that we obtained

files '_tree.pyx' and '_tree.pxd'
 - this is the cython code of our base tree. This code comes from sklearn and it was cleaned to keep only what is usefull. In addition, we added our proposed splitting criterion in the class AveragePrecision in the file '_tree.pyx'

file 'mytree.py'
 - this is the python class that compiles and import the cython code in files '_tree.pyx' and '_tree.pxd'. The class provides neccessary methods to train and predict decision trees using our proposed AveragePrecision criterion, but also two existing criterions which are Gini and Entropy

file 'MetaAP.py'
 - this is the code of our proposed method that uses the base decision tree from the file 'mytree.py' with the AveragePrecision splitting criterion

file 'ADT.py'
 - this is the decision tree code for Gini and Entropy criterion that we compare with our method

file 'ADTRF.py'
 - this is the random forest code for Gini and Entropy criterion that we compare with our method

file 'TreeRank.R'
 - this is the R code of TreeRank that comes from the R package of the authors of this method. The code was cleaned to keep only what is usefull.

file 'TreeRank.py'
 - this is the python wrapper of 'TreeRank.R' that uses the library rpy2 to launch in R TreeRank and recover the results in python

file 'SGBAP.py'
 - this is one of the compared methods in our experiments

file 'plot.py'
 - this file loads the result files in the 'results' folder and creates three figures that are present in the paper

file 'plotTrees.py'
 - this file creates the graphical representation of the actual three trees Entropy, TreeRank and MetaAP on one of the 28 dataset

folder 'figures'
 - the resulting figures are created in this folder. We provide the figures generated by our code here
